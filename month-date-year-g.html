	<p>February DATE, 2022 | [ANALYSIS] The CIA Is Operating a Secret Bulk Data Collection Program. And We Knew About It.</p>
	
	<p>An incredibly important and alarming story came to light on Friday.</p>

    <p>The letter is written by Senators Ron Wyden and Martin Heinrich and dated April 13, 2021.</p>

    <p>[PUBLISH LETTER]</p>

    <p>In the letter, Senators Wyden and Heinrich write to the Director of National Intelligence and the Director of the CIA.</p>

	<p>They request a "declassification review" of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board's review of "Executive Order 
    12333 Central Intelligence Agency Deep Dive II".</p>

    <p>The letter goes on to state "The review covers the CIA's bulk [REDACTED]".</p>

    <p>Now, Executive Order 12333 dates back to the early 1980s and was intended to extend the responsibilities of intelligence 
    agencies and to direct the leaders of federal agencies to comply with CIA requests for information.</p>

    <p>It has been amended since but those amendments have only worked to the favor of the CIA.</p>

    <p>What CIA bulk collection program the letter refers to is still unclear as it remains secret and classified.</p>

    <p>The Senators are highly critical of the secret program yet have not revealed any specific details about it.</p>

    <p>The concerns expressed by the Senators cites the secret nature of the program and suggest that the CIA has not been entirely 
    transparent about the secret program, its scale and purpose.</p>

    <p>Large chunks of the letter are heavily redacted which suggests the secret program being run by the CIA is extensive.</p>

    <p>The point is made that lawmakers have worked hard to restrict, and in some cases prohibit, specific bulk data collection 
    programs which which have previously been operated by the NSA.</p>

    <p>It appears the CIA has expressed complete disregard to the changes made to data collection laws and oversight, instead running 
    a bulk data collection program of its own in secret, which includes information on domestic American citizens.</p>

    <p>Despite the CIA having claimed that it always operates within the scope of the law and is transparent with Congress, we know 
    this is false because the Senators state disclosure of the secret program has been kept from the public and Congress.</p>

    <p>It is also claimed the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence were also unaware of the secret program until the PCLOB report 
    was delivered, March 2021.</p>

    <p>The Senators close the letter by reiterating the importance of declassiciation of the "Deep Dive II" report.</p>

    <p>They also call for the declassification of two other reports related to Executive Order 12333.</p>

    <p>This is a big story and many areas of the mainstream media appear to be surprised by the revelations the CIA is operating 
    secret mass-surveillance and data collection programs outside of the law.</p>

    <p>But here's the real kicker - Freedom Publishers Union have been talking about this since at least 2017.</p>

    <p>[PUBLISH TWEET SCREENSHOT]</p>

    <p>Without being able to source or produce any definitive evidence, we have always known the CIA was operating secret programs and 
    it would only be a matter of time before the public would learn of their existence.</p>

    <p>Admittedly, our own information we have put together to guide us to this conclusion is not definitive and is cirumstantial at best, 
    but the point is if the fake news media pack started paying better attention they would have been able to form the same conclusion that 
    we have been able to.</p>

    <p>Not only have we repeatedly suggested the existence of these programs, we have also suggested the CIA was oeprating outside of the 
    scope of the law.</p>

    <p>The letter by the Senators indicate that we were probably correct on this fact too.</p>

    <p>Let us just say this now, so it's on the public record, this latter is exposing the tip of the ice-berg of the extent of the secret 
    programs the CIA is operating.</p>

    <p>Don't look away, because this story is not going away.</p>
