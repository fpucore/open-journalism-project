	<p>MONTH DATE, 2022 | [ANALYSIS] Southern Downs Realty Engaging in Unethical and Unfair Treatment from Elderly Tenants</p>
	
	<p>The country town of Warwick is located in the Southern Downs region in Queensland State.</p>

	<p>According to 2020 census data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the town has 15,199 residents.</p>
    
    <p>The town is surrounded by postcard views in all directions, with vast areas built up by farming and agriculture.</p>

    <p>The town is a historical town where many elderly residents call home.</p>

    <p>It is the town former resident Rose (name changed) called home for several years, up until 2019 when she was forced to 
    reconsider her options due to a decline in health.</p>

    <p>Rose lived independently in a typical house, quietly, along with her two dogs for company.</p>

    <p>Family often visited Rose, coming in from different parts of the State to check on her well-being.</p>

    <p>Like most tenants leasing their home, Rose was under a lease.</p>

    <p>In Queensland State it is usually required tenants inform the agent or property manager two weeks prior to lease end of 
    their intention to leave.</p>

    <p>This is known as a "Notice of intention to leave" or simply "Form 13".</p>

    <p>Regulations state that the tenant must provide notice two weeks before the date of the end of lease, however there is some 
    flexibility when personal circumstances unexpectedly change.
    </p>
	
    <p>In Rose's case, it was the unforeseen circumstances of her declining health which forced her to make the decision to leave 
    the property, to find accomodation much closer to her family.
    </p>

    <p>Rose's case was strong and was well supported by medical advice she had received.</p>

    <p>To assist Rose with the process she sought assistance from her son.</p>

    <p>Her son contacted the property agent, Southern Downs Realty, writing a letter on March 26, 2019, explaining the exceptional 
        circumstances that Rose was facing and why she was required to vacate the property before the end of lease.</p>

    <p>A copy of the letter has been provided to Freedom Publishers Union.</p>

    [INSERT LETTER]

    <p>Rose was well acquantaed with the property owners, Kerin Politch and Emily Paech.</p>

    <p>Kerin and Emily are a couple with children and own multiple properties.</p>

    <p>They also operate muliple small businesses.</p>

    <p>Kerin and Emily had regularly attended inspections of the property and on many occasion Kerin had carried out maintenance on the 
    property.
    </p>
    
    <p>Rose enjoyed a friendly relationship with both Kerin and Emily, informing them personally of her declining health, prior to notifying 
    the property agent, of the requirement to break the lease.
    </p>

    <p>There was no dispute from Kerin or Emily and they were extremely sympathtic to Rose, wishing her well.</p>

    <p>Expecting there to be no dispute from the property agent, as there was no dispute from comversations Rose had with the property owners, 
    Rose and her sons commenced the process of packing up the house.</p>

    <p>There was nothing the property agent could do to dispute Rose's circumstances, as her decision was both prompted by and supported by 
    medical advice.
    </p>

    <p>What Southern Down Realty and the property owners done next is unethical, unfair and still shocks Rose to this day.</p>

    <p>Once the property was vacated, three of Rose's sons entered the premises for cleaning.</p>

    <p>Cleaning a property and having it sprayed from pest control is a requirement when vacating a rental property in Queensland State.</p>

    <p>Following the cleaning of the property by Rose's three sons, photos were taken as evidence.
    </p>

    <p>Photographic evidence when vacating a rental property is regular practise and advised.</p>

    <p>The photos were supplied to Freedom Publishers Union as evidence and we can verify the property was cleaned to an extremely high 
        standard and exceeded the required standards.
    </p>

    <p>Gardens were also tidied and maintained, as required under the lease.</p>

    <p>Rose did fail to get the property sprayed by pest control, but was more than happy for the property agent to organize it and have the 
        funds deducted from the Bond due to be returned to Rose once everything was settled.
    </p>

    <p>Then things got strange.</p>

    <p>April 26, 2019, Southern Downs Realty sent a collection of invoices to Rose.</p>

    [INSERT EMAIL]

    <p>One invoice showed the property had been professionally cleaned, despite the property being cleaned already.</p>

    <p>The same invoice showed the property was sprayed for fleas, which is a requirement of vacating a rental property and of which 
        Rose was already prepared to pay for.</p>

    <p>This invoice was dated April 11, 2019.</p>

    [INSERT INVOICE]

    <p>The charge of the invoice to Rose was $490.00.</p>

    <p>Another invoice showed lawn mowing and garden maintenance.</p>

    <p>Freedom Publishers Union confirms these are false claims, as we cited the photos post exit and the lawns had already been mowed 
        and the garden was maintained to the same standard as when Rose had entered the property.
    </p>

    <p>This invoice is dated April 24, 2019.</p>

    [INSERT INVOICE]

    <p>The invoice is from ABC Lawn Mowing & Garden Care Services, with the Australian Business Number (ABN) 28 336 628 542.</p>

    <p>The address for the business us listed as 498 Lyndhurst Lane, Warwick - the home address of the property owners Kerin Politch 
        and Emily Paech.</p>

    <p>The invoice is billed to Emily Paech.</p>

    <p>Kerin Politch had billed his own partner, Emily Paech, for work carried out by their own business on a property they own and the 
        invoice was then forwarded to Rose, claiming the false claim the work was necessary.
    </p>

    <p>The charge of the invoice to Rose was $264.00.</p>
