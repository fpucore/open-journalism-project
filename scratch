While we cannot say definitively how long Babyfist has been a member of the anon the community, but our understanding 
is he is well accustomed to the anon culture and has an encyclopeiadic knowledge of the culture and its rich history.

The origins of Q are complex. There is a lot of research available in the public domain which is very credible, yet 
unfortunately there is also a lot that is not and is in fact disinformation.

The darker aspects QAnon is the subject of military psychological operations, or psyops as its commonly referred to as.

Babyfist is the owner of the ABCU_8 board on the 8kun platform. He also owns Deep Digs. He has been subjected to vindication 
and targeted censorship on the 8kun platform, partocularly in the QResearcr board - one of the most popular boards on 8kun 
as it was used by Q.

According to Babyfist and information pulled from ABCU_8 board on 8kun, ABCU8 is operated by a group of individuals who call 
themselves The Laughing Men.

According to information pulled from the ABCU board, The Laughing Men is comprised of:

BOARD OWNER & VOLUNTEERS:

BO: babyfist - @babyfist - babyfist@protonmail.com

Babyfist is the most public member of the group, along with Sgt. B.

The identity of Sgt. B remains unknown. Some anons have suggested that Sgt. B is actually a persona of Babyfist himself.

We have been unable to confirm any possible identity of who Sgt. B could be and the possibility that Sgt B is Babyfist cannot be 
ruled out.

Babyfist maintains that he is not Sgt. B and continues to claim that Sgt. B prefers to remain in the dark and not engage with the 
anon community.

While this may seem like a logical explanation, there appears to be more evidence to suggest Babyfists involvement with the 
persona of Sgt. B than any evidence which can dismiss the claims.

A recent cryptic image has been circulating quietly which may prove key to answering some of these questions about Babyfist, his 
activities and the individuals he is associated with.

But before we take a look at the image that has been circulating, we need to revisit the post on 8kun board /projectdcomms/

This particular board is known as Q's board because it is limited to allow only posts from those with elevated credentials. Who 
might have those credentials? A Global Volunteer (GV) on 8kun. Babyfist was formerly a GV for 8kun.

On May 29, 2021, the anon community went a little bit crazy when it a new post appeared on /projectdcomms/

Automated Q post aggregator sites actually registered the post as Q post #4954. It would be a false positive and required human interaction 
to remove the post from aggregators.

Who posted to Q's board without permission? The identity is simply "B".

The post caused some initial controversy. As said, the only person who could post to the board is Q or a GV.

While technically, it could have been any GV that posted, but the author "B" provided good indication it was the same B as the 
identity who posts to ABCU board as "B".

In a video by Jim Watkins, owner of 8kun, he helped offer some clarify as to the identity of the individual who posted to the board.

Watkins did not explicitly name the individual but did state that it was a GV and most likely one of identities that call themselves 
The Laughing Men.

This revelation from Watkins was important and cannot be ignored because Watkins is one of only a handful with full administrative access 
to the 8kun platform and had unique insight into the identity of the individual who posted.

There was now little doubt that it was indeed Babyfist, who had GV access at this time, who had made the post using the identity of "B".

Clearly upset that Q's board had been tampered with but someone who was not Q, or not authorized to post in the board by the Q team, Watkins 
followed up by removing the GV credentials from Babyfist.

While the motivation and reason for Babyfist to make the B post in /projectdcomms/ is unclear, the information was enough for Babyfist to 
offer an explanation on his Gab account.

In the explanation offered by Babyfist in the post to his Gab account, he claims it was most probably Sgt. B who posted as "B" to /projectdcomms/
using his credentials.

Is this plausible? Well, both yes and no.

It's certainly possibly but that's if you believe Sgt. B is in fact a real person and not a persona controlled by Babyfist.

As it is certainly possible that Sgt. B did make the post, how does that explain the claim by Jim Watkins that the IP hash was the same as 
that of members of The Laughing Men which post in ABCU?

According to Babyfist it is because they all share a VPN which results in the IP address appearing to be the same for members of The 
Laughing Men, despite them being separate people.

It's possible, probably not plausible and not very believable. But the truth is, we do not know and only have the words of Jim Watkins and 
Babyfist to make a determination.

The interesting claim by Babyfist is that he will always be open and clear with anons, but it seems that is applies selectively.

Babyfist is very close to a small group of individuals. This includes the Cicada 3301 and composer, Thomas Schoenberger. He also is very 
close to Marcia Stockton. Stockton works closely with Schoenberger with music production and formerly worked for ABCU, creating and 
diseminating memes. While both Babyfist and Stockton claim she is no longer working with ABCU, we cannot verify the claims from any other 
source. Schoenberger is not associated with ABCU in any way to the best of our knowledge and his historical activities remain with Cicada 
3301 and composing music.

It is unclear how Babyfist first met Thomas Schoenberger but according to information extracted from private DMs, Babyfist claims he met 
Schoenberger 7 years ago.

When we talk about the origins of Q and the identity of Q, we are actually speaking about two entirely different things.

The origins of Q are deep, complex and at times mysterious. The identity of two is also complex but since the emergence of 
Q in October 2017, much research has been done to uncover the identity of the individuals who pushed the Q narrative. So good is 
much of the research, backed by evidence and first-hand accounts by involved individuals, we now have a very good understanding 
of the individuals behind Q and the various stages of the narrative.

Let's start with a brief look at the origins of Q.

Now let's look at the identities of the individuals involved in Q.
